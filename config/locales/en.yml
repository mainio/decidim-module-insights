          title: This is a preliminary plan of the City of Helsinki
          description_html: |
            <p>Plans have been collected on this page that fit the area's OmaStadi budget. There is no funding available for them from the city budget yet. You can accelerate the realization of the plan and propose it as it is or take ideas from it as the basis of your own proposal. You can submit an OmaStadi proposal under the Make a proposal section.</p>
            <p>The city makes plans in order to implement the city services equally in different parts of the city in the future. This is how the city responds to the changing needs of its residents.</p>
            <p>The city will implement this plan in the coming years if the city council decides to give funding for it in the city budget.</p>
