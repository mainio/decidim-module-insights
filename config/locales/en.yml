            <p>The page presents a compilation of plans that fit the district's OmaStadi budget. They do not yet have funding from the city budget. You can speed up the implementation of a particular plan and suggest it as it is or take ideas from it and use them as a basis for your proposal. You can submit the OmaStadi proposal in the "Submit a proposal" section.</p>
            <p>The city prepares plans to ensure that the city's services are implemented equally in different parts of the city in the future. In this way, the city responds to the changing needs of its residents.</p>
            <p>The city will implement this plan in the coming years if the City Council decides to fund it in the city budget.</p>
